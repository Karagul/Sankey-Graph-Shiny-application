ABSTRACT

 Named after ther Irish engineer "Mathew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey"", the Sankey chart is used to visualize the energy flows, costs, losses, generated by process.
 It's a type of flowchart in which the width of arrows is proportional to the shown flow.In practice, Sankey Diagrams are used by large and small companies to 
understand networkflow. For example, a company may highlight contents that are driving visitors to its website and how many are reacting to it. Those graphs are 
of help of governments to report energy use and consumption. It can also be useful for business surveys when trying to understand their target market. 
Visualizing survey data by factors like locations, industry and demographics can reveal patterns that would be harder to spot with statistical analysis.
